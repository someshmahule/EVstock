The app is a Flask web application that takes a stock ticker as input and provides a prediction of the next day's closing price for that stock.
The app fetches historical prices for the ticker using the Yahoo Finance API, preprocesses the data using Scikit-learn, and fits a linear regression model to make predictions. 
It then displays the historical and predicted prices using Plotly. The app also generates a map of EV charging stations near the user's location using Folium and the OpenChargeMap API. 
The app also compareâ€™s two EV stock tickers and give graphs and plots for news sentiment analysis , historical volatility and stock price comparison.
